## Gsmodutils
This project is shared using the gsmodutils project.
This is a python tool designed to allow users to share genome scale modles with associated validation scripts and other data.
For full details see the gsmodutils project.

## Docker image
A docker image of this project can be used if docker is installed on your system.
Docker containers are similar to virtual machines and allow users to create isolated environments.
For this project all tests can run inside the buildable docker container that creates a full build of the gsmodutils software stack.
This is fully compatible with cobrapy models.

## ScrumPy
This model was built and developed using the scrumpy software.
Whilst a cobra version of this model is made available all the initial design and testing was based around the ScrumPy software.
